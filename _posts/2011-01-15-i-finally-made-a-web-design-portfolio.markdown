<p>For those of you who don't know, I've been doing a web design job for a large corporation for about three years now.  I've been intending to make a grand web design portfolio for quite a while now.  I would occasionally research Wordpress themes and gallery plugins to come up with the best possible backend for the maintenance of my impressive online professional presence.  I originally though this blog would be a portfolio, but it ended up being full of <a href="http://www.tmbritton.com/2010/10/back-by-popular-demand/">paintings of naked ladies</a> and meditations on the <a href="http://www.tmbritton.com/2010/01/drawing-cocks/">value of drawing penises</a>.</p>
<p>Tuesday night I got off work and spurred by the possibility of picking up some lucrative freelance work I finally made a portfolio page.  I was curious to see how quickly I could pull it off.  It took me about four hours to make the page I'm presenting to you.</p>
<p>I was going for a clean and minimal presentation.  I think it's important when building an image gallery to let the design recede and for the images to be prominent.  You don't want to overwhelm what you're trying to present with excessive decorative elements.  To fancy it up a bit, I did a quick show/hide jQuery script for the project info and used the <a href="http://fancybox.net/">Fancybox</a> plugin for the image expansion effect.  Both degrade gracefully, yay for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement">progressive enhancement</a>.</p>
<p>I found that I really don't have a lot outside of my job stuff to show.  I'm hoping to fix that this year.  Time to embrace my inner nerd and do more freelance work outside of my nine to five.  I'm finding that I quite enjoy the web design stuff.  It's a great mix of design and figuring stuff out.  I get a thrill of victory when I've been debugging a PHP script for an hour and a half and finally get the damn thing to work.  I beat the computer.  I win.</p>
<p>So without further ado, submitted for you approval, my new <a href="http://www.tmbritton.com/web/">four hour web design portfolio</a>.  Eventually it will all be integrated with this blog and perhaps an art gallery and a photo site.  If you're my friend on Facebook you may have seen my recent spate of faux-arty digital photos being posted to Flickr.  For a new nerdy project I'm considering building a gallery for them and bring them in using the Flick API.  Basically I'll be using Flickr as a CMS.  But, we'll see.  It took me a long time to get around to making the simple portfolio page, so something just for fun like a photo gallery can be put off indefinitely.</p>
