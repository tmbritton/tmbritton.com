<p>That's right kids, here's some more of that watercolor that you crave.  I took my <a href="http://www.cheapjoes.com/art-supply/0390639_4533_winsor-newton-cotman-field-box.asp">little kit</a> into a figure drawing session and this is what happened.  Messy, drippy, but I've seen and done worse.  Putting these things on a scanner really bleaches them out.  Either it's burn the hell out of them on a scanner or make them blurry and orange with the digital camera.  I think it's time to look into upgrading my process for getting paintings into the computer.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and this is what happens when I start mixing the watercolors with digital stuff.</p>
