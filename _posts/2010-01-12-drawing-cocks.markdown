<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="011210-1" href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/4270068519/011210-1.html"><img class="float-right" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2746/4270068519_1609045240_m.jpg" alt="011210-1" width="175" height="240" /></a> When I was in college a lot of students omitted the cock from their figure drawings.  Some even didn't draw nipples on the female models, which is silly since it's such a good indicator of the position of the ribcage.  I don't know exactly why they wouldn't draw the cock.  Insecurity of some sort perhaps?  Perhaps they thought people would think they were gay if they saw charcoal drawings of cock in their newsprint pads.  Or perceived as straight in the case of the females.</p>
<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="011210-2" href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/4270068571/011210-2.html"><img class="float-left" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2733/4270068571_7b4db86c96_m.jpg" alt="011210-2" width="175" height="240" /></a> A cock is far more obvious in it's absence.  Therefore kids, in your drawings from now on be sure to include a cock if it is appropriate.  Now, it doesn't have to be fully rendered.  It's not terribly important to the overall gesture of the figure.  It's position is determined mostly by gravity, and occasionally bloodflow.  No need to make it the focal point.  Unless it is.</p>
<p>So don't be afraid to draw those cocks.  Stick a thumb in the eye of your puritan parents and give them a framed drawing of a naked dude for Christmas.</p>
