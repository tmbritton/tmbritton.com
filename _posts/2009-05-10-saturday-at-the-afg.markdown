<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" title="Acrylic Portrait of Drea 050909" href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3517187894/acrylic-portrait-of-drea-050909.html"><img class="float-right" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3555/3517187894_984dbe46ae.jpg" alt="Acrylic Portrait of Drea 050909" width="346" height="500" /></a> I was pretty productive today.  It was one of the first Saturdays in a while that I've woken up without a hangover.  I went painting at the <a href="http://www.austinfigurative.com">Austin Figurative Gallery</a> from 1-4 today.  Then I went for a run.  Then I did web stuff at <a href="http://caffemedici.com/">Café Medici</a>.  They have a superior latté.</p>
<p>I may be harming the drunken artist image I'm trying to cultivate online with all this talk of running and lattés.  I'm going to have to stop before I reveal myself as the yuppie douchebag that I've become.  I need a 40.</p>
