<p><a href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3196275692/digital-landscape.html" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Digital Landscape"><img class="float-right" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3329/3196275692_32c9b21b61_m.jpg" alt="Digital Landscape" width="240" height="240" /></a>Here's a landscape.  Took about two hours in Painter and Photoshop.  It was looking terrible until I brought it into Photoshop and started overlaying a bunch of crap onto it.  Adjustment layers and Overlay layers are the key to this digital stuff. </p>
<p>In Painter it was just a bit too smooth.  I had to bring it into Photoshop to add the texture and those brushstrokes.  Painter can do some really nice stuff with simulating natural media, but I just don't know it as well as Photoshop.  I probably just need to find a brush I like, and use it until it makes sense.  </p>
