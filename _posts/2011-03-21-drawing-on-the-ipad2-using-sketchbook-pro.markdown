<p>I took the new iPad to figure drawing tonight.  It ended up pretty well.  I'm getting the hang of it.  I'm definitely slower with the iPad than I would be with Photoshop and a Wacom, but it would be damn inconvenient to drag a laptop and a tablet around with me.  The lack of pressure sensitivity sucks, but it's just a limitation to work around.  Hopefully there's some shortcuts I have yet to discover that will allow me to more easily resize the brush and adjust opacity.  Color picking works well.  I'd say with some time, I should be able to bust out some good work with Sketchbook Pro.</p>
<p>Also, the dark sketchy drawing was done using a program called <a href="http://mrdoob.com/projects/harmony/">Harmony</a>.  It's a program that runs in-browser in Safari using HTML5 canvas and Javascript.  I absolutely love it.  I'm gonna take it out behind the middle school and get it pregnant.</p>
