<p>Howdy there true believers.  Tonight I went to Gibson and did a couple of watercolors while sitting at the bar.  I wanted to spend some time doing arty stuff tonight, but I seem to have the opposite affliction to agoraphobia.  Claustrphobia?  I have an irrational fear of being home.  So I took my sketchbook and watercolors to Gibson, my friendly neighborhood bar and did couple of paintings.  It was enjoyable.  I got there around 7 and had a couple of hours to talk with my friend who worked there while it was slow.  Afterward I was heads down into the painting and was surrounded by people ordering drinks.  While making this post, I have one question.  Is The Crow soundtrack really the best CD of all time?  Or is it just because I was 15 in 1994 that I respond so fervently to this music?  Is it a Pavlovian response to the feeling of accomplishment of having grown pubic hair?  Maybe the hormonal high of having a new batch of zits to pop every morning felt much more pertinent than the air conditioned nightmare of the cubicle life?</p>
<p>Meh, now that I look at these I see that the photoshopping of the painting of Liz is bullshit.  The straight-up watercolor is much better.  Oh well, it's late.  If I return to it at some point, it can be improved.</p>
