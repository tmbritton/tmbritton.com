<p><a href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3186506415/digital-pipe.html" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Digital Pipe"><img class="float-right" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3298/3186506415_50c63ba4b1_m.jpg" alt="Digital Pipe" width="163" height="240" /></a> I did this one because I rarely draw anything mechanical.  If you look at my previous post you can see that the attempt at stereos were rather haggard.  I didthis one so that the mechanical object was the focus of the picture.  Sort of a supplement to all the figure drawing.  I found that I can indeed draw straight lines with the tablet if I try.  I was just being lazy and ignoring backgrounds.  So next time I'm being lazy and not wanting to draw a table or something I can just look at this one and make myself do it.</p>
<p>This is all photoshop with a wacom tablet.  Probably excessively overlaid with texture, but that how I like to do things.</p>
