<p><img src="/assets/img/2008/10/me-3.jpg" alt="Self Portrait" title="self-portrait" width="300" height="382" class="float-right" />This site, tmbritton.com, is finally ready to launch!  It took quite a while of picking at it and a long concerted effort this weekend, but it's finally in a working state.  I've been a professional web-guy without a website for too long.  There's still things here and there that bother me.  I still need to get a sidebar that is consistent in the Art Gallery section.  I need to figure out what I want all the pages to be and say, apart from the blog portion.</p>
<p>I should probably give some props to all the sources and references I found that helped when building this site.  I build it based on the <a href="http://elliotjaystocks.com/blog/archive/2008/starkers-for-wordpress-262/">Starkers</a> naked theme by Elliot Jay Stocks.  Basically this is a theme that is stripped down to the database calls.  You put in your HTML around the calls and it makes it quite quick to build a theme if you've already done a HTML/CSS layout.  This <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/09/15/wordpress-developers-toolbox/">post</a> on <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> is a good compendium of resources for Wordpress development.  I probably used several of the tutorials linked from this page.</p>
<p>Probably the greatest help for this site was the <a href="http://tantannoodles.com/toolkit/photo-album/">Flickr Photo Album</a> plugin.  I was originally just looking for a way to do some random images in the sidebar.  Then I saw that it could do galleries based on sets of images in Flickr.  Then I saw the tagging.  It is so cool that I can tag all my drawings and paintings and bring them up based on materials I used and subject matter, for example.</p>
<p>I'll update this site frequently with new drawings and paintings as well as more computer-centric stuff.  So, if anybody who is not my mother happens to see this site, thanks for looking.  And Mom, thanks for looking as well.</p>
