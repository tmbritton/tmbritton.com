<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="111408-1" href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3029395980/111408-1.html"><img class="float-right" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3185/3029395980_cb22caafec_m.jpg" alt="111408-1" width="240" height="240" /></a> I was messing around with Photoshop tonight, playing around with some brushes, and this is what I came up with.  Why paint in Photoshop?  Well, it's very convenient for print work.  If I had an illustration gig of some type I would almost certainly do it digitally.  Production and delivery in one tidy package.  The only thing lacking from doing work digitally is a physical end product.  So to me if feels kinda cold.</p>
<p>There is a speed advantage as well.  Where real paintings that I've done on this site take many hours, multiple sessions over days, this took about an hour.</p>
<p>The brushes I was playing with came from a downloaded brush set from <a href="http://www.bittbox.com/">Bittbox</a>.Â  Grab them <a href="http://www.bittbox.com/freebies/free-hi-res-watercolor-photoshop-brushes-set-ii/">here</a>.</p>
