<p>Thursday night I went to the Vargas house and painted a pair of boots.  An interesting thing about this painting is that I didn't use any white until I did the background.  Interesting to me anyway.  Normally white is the color I use the most.  It wasn't something I intended to do, it just happened.  Could have something to do with painting black boots.</p>
