<p>It's been quite a week of art.  Two figure sessions, a still life, and I have painting on the easel.  Feel good, like I'm not being a drunken lout with all of my spare time.  Although nothing prevents me from being a drunken lout while making art.  Here's a batch of watercolor figure painting from tonight at the AFG.  I think our model tonight was <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=rose+mcgowan&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=204-Tbz7OoGC8gbhmMCPCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQsAQwAA&amp;biw=1495&amp;bih=856">Rose McGowan</a>.  As always, the prettier the girl, the shittier the drawing.  Ok, that's not always the rule.  There are some people's features that I just seem to get and be able to do a good job of drawing every time.  This was not one of those people.</p>

<p>Oh, and I see a search hit in my website stats for "Tom Britton watercolor prints".  Encouraging?  A fluke?  It turns out that watercolors scan well, unlike oil painting.  Watercolor prints would be pretty easy to do, no photography studio involved.</p>
