<p>The paintings that I did for the roommates were both 24x24 with a 4 inch border done on 3/4 inch plywood.  I lifted that directly from something I saw on the studio tour.</p>

<p>It seemed to go well.  Spiderhouse opened the bar in the USAA so we had drinks available.  The music was excellent and we had a good amount of art up in the place, including some incredible photographs by a guy named George.  Unfortunately hte rest of his name eludes me.</p>

<p>I just finished a painting of a street scene of Austin.  This is East 6th Street, somewhere around Rio Rita.</p>
