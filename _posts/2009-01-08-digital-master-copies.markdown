I worked on these probably a couple of hours each.  These are all photoshop, looking at the paintings for reference.  The first is a Bougoureau, the second Michelangelo.  These are great practice.  I feel like they're major steps forward in my handling of the wacom.  I didn't get as far along with the second as I would have liked.  For some reason it was taking longer than the other.</p>

It was the first oil painting that I did that I thought was decent.  It wasn't, of course, just much better than what I had been doing.  You learn a lot about how to depict form by doing these.  You see how they handled.  Looking just doesn't do it.  The only way to learn is by hand.</p>
