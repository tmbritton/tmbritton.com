<p>Tonight we had a great model at the AFG.  Very dynamic and challenging poses.  They're the pencil drawings below.  I realized that it had been quite a while since I'd scanned anything.  So I scanned a bunch of stuff in the sketchbook tonight.</p>
<p>I've been doing a lot of freelance recently also.  I just finished the <a href="http://skycandyaustin.com/">Sky Candy</a> website and I'm working on another one for <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Native-Nom-Nom/152016241530398">Native Nom Nom</a>, a new restaurant that's just opened in south Austin.  So these projects take up art time and so does going out and drinking.  But as Jack Nicholson said, "All and no play makes Jack a dull boy."</p>
<p>Here's a bunch of recent figure drawings.  I have charcoals to photograph also.  Maybe next post.</p>
