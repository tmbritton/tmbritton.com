<p>I finished up a freelance website a couple of weeks ago.  I made a custom Wordpress template for the lovely ladies at <a href="http://skycandyaustin.com/">Sky Candy</a>.  Some of the good stuff with this template is the use of the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/widget-logic/">Widget Logic</a> plugin to allow them to target sidebar widgets to individual pages.  This lets them do things like add class info to their instructor pages.  Surprisingly, this just isn't something that Wordpress does out of the box.  Seems like a bit of no-brainer.</p>

<p>I tried to use the fancy new HTML5 tags as well.  &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and all that.  It worked great in all the browsers on my Mac, of course.  But once I started checking in IE, nothing below IE9 knew what to do with them.  This is despite starting with the <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>.  I had to go through and replace all that stuff with &lt;div&gt;s before launching the site.</p>

<p>So, here it is.  <a href="http://skycandyaustin.com/">Check out the live site</a>.</p>
