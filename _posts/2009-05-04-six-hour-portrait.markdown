<p>I skipped the Faster than the Speed of Light fundraiser tonight because I got myself involved in a six hour portrait.  It's been years since I spent this long on a painting, so I thought I'd see what happened.</p>
<p>I experimented a bit with the process.  I first did a tonal charcoal under-drawing, then painted over that with acrylic, then finished up with oil.  It's a pretty good process, but I should have stopped after my initial glazing with the oil.  The features were much stronger in the acrylic under-painting.  Although you wouldn't know it from my painting the model was actually very beautiful.</p>
<p>I also did a quick photoshoppery to it, to see if I could improve it.</p>
