<p><a href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3184467658/digital-figure-practice.html" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Digital Figure Practice"><img class="float-right" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3353/3184467658_3578b85a92_m.jpg" alt="Digital Figure Practice" width="160" height="240" /></a> So I did this digital painting as practice.  Then I started playing with it some more in Photoshop and came up with something more designy and I think that ultimately stands on it's own as a piece of art.  The painting was referenced from a photograph, so I can't take credit for the composition or the model.  But I think it turned out well.  I like that I'm getting to the point with the wacom that I can generate my own content for these sort of manipulations and don't always have to use photographs, which usually involves using somebody else's photograph.  </p>
<p>I always try to write these posts late at night after drawing when I'm tired.  They just turn into rambling messes.<br />

I need to go through my own photos and see if there's anything in there I can do anything with.  It's easy to make a nice image if you're copying a picture of a naked woman.  Unfortunately the supply of photographs of naked women that I've taken is rather slim.  I may have to content myself with doing digital paintings and designs of empty booze containers.  </p>
