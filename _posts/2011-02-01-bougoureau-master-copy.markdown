<p>Master copies are good.  I haven't done a lot, because I'm a lazy bastard.  But whenever I do, I always have moments where I think, "Ah-ha, that's how you do it."  A good instance here were the nostrils.  If you <a href="http://www.artrenewal.org/pages/artwork.php?artworkid=14259&amp;size=large">look at the original</a>, you can see how warm he paints the nostrils.  This makes sense because the skin is thin and light shines through and colors everything red.  Think holding a flashlight up to your hand.  There were lots of very warm places, mostly in the skin folds.  I'm gonna do more of these, always a good art workout.  Anything you wanna see me try to copy and eventually throw cadmium red on top of?</p>
