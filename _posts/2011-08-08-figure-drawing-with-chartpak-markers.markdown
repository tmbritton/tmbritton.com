<p>I have this pack of <a href="http://www.chartpak.com/">Chartpak</a> markers that had been sitting around gathering dust for a few years, so I decided to take them to figure drawing tonight.  It took me a few drawings to start to get the hang of them.  I only like two drawing from tonight.  The rest are crap that I'm not going to put on the internet.</p>
<p>Our model tonight was the indefatigable Kelli Bland.  I always end up with good drawings when Kelli models. Here's a couple of past drawings, for example:</p>
<p>
  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-604" title="Kelli Circa 2008" src="/assets/img/2011/08/081608-3-230x300.jpg" alt="Kelli Circa 2008" width="230" height="300" />

  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-605" title="Kelli circa 2009" src="/assets/img/2011/08/072809-2-234x300.jpg" alt="Kelli circa 2009" width="234" height="300" />
</p>
<p>Good lord, I just realized that the first drawing is almost exactly three years old.  Have I really been in Austin that long?  Have I really been doing weekly figure drawings that long? No wonder the portfolio I filled with paintings on paper weighs about 40 pounds.</p>
<p>Here's a couple from tonight, after I'd gotten used to the markers:</p>
<p>
  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-607" title="Kelli with Marker" src="/assets/img/2011/08/080811-2-208x300.jpg" alt="Kelli with Marker" width="208" height="300" />
  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-606" title="Kelli with Marker" src="/assets/img/2011/08/080811-1-300x216.jpg" alt="Kelli with Marker" width="300" height="216" />
