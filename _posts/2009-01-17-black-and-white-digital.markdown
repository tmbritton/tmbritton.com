<p><a href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3197937807/thinking.html" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Thinking"><img class="float-right" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3415/3197937807_1b1ac4e927_m.jpg" alt="Thinking" width="182" height="240" /></a> Here's a few black and white digital images from photo reference.  Not sure where the photos came from anymore.  They've been on my hard drive for years.  I'm finally getting productive enough to start going through images in my reference folders.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3203438645/gloria-swanson-portrait.html" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Gloria Swanson portrait"><img class="float-left" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3123/3203438645_cc1f926ff5_m.jpg" alt="Gloria Swanson portrait" width="214" height="240" /></a> I discovered the unsharpen mask filter with the last two of these.  It really makes an image look more finished.  By flipping back to the original image after applying the filter you can see the original image is much more blurry.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3204288024/dancer.html" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Dancer"><img class="float-right" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3420/3204288024_b751fdd2c7_m.jpg" alt="Dancer" width="181" height="240" /></a> Ah yes, filters, the beauty of Photoshop.</p>
<p>So, the wacom has been fun since I finally got used to it.  It was hard at first, looking at the screen and having the hand on the tablet.  Actually, I've had it for 3 years, so I can't say it was hard at first.</p>
