<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="110308-1" href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3001157753/110308-1.html"><img class="float-right" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3172/3001157753_f95e16f8c2_m.jpg" alt="110308-1" width="190" height="240" /></a> The model didn't show up to the figure drawing session tonight, but it turned out pretty cool anyway.  Artists posed and I did some portraits of people I've been drawing with for a while.  I think they turned out pretty well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3001995238/110308-2.html" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="110308-2"><img class="float-left" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3150/3001995238_3905f4808b_m.jpg" alt="110308-2" width="174" height="240" /></a> I found that guys are much easier to draw than girls.  I was thinking that I was terrible at portraits until tonight because I'd only been doing portraits of girls for the last six months.  Guys have way more bumps on their faces and parts of their skull stick out more.  It's easier to relate all that detail to each other.  With girls their faces are much smoother, with much more subtle transitions.  Not to make broad generalizations.  Or generalizations about broads.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3001995304/110308-3.html" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="110308-3"><img class="float-right" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3217/3001995304_cc8c1303f8_m.jpg" alt="110308-3" width="180" height="240" /></a> I am impossible to draw.  My face is round and smooth and I have no visible upper eyelids due to my thick cro-magnun brow.  But it helps me take a punch, so it's a trade off I'm willing to make.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3001157959/110308-4.html" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="110308-4"><img class="float-left" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3048/3001157959_aa2ef7368a_m.jpg" alt="110308-4" width="175" height="240" /></a> That's it for tonight.  I haven't had any adventures since last night's post.  Hopefully this is enough text to balance the images.</p>
