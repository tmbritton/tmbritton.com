<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Huge 4 x 2 acrylic painting" href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3369727488/huge-4-x-2-acrylic-painting.html"><img class="float-right" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3418/3369727488_ba0d08a429_m.jpg" alt="Huge 4 x 2 acrylic painting" width="156" height="240" /></a> I went to the <a href="http://austinfigurative.com/">Austin Figurative Gallery</a> to paint tonight.  They have a cool set up.  The front of it is the <a href="http://www.craftsmanfurniture-blueocean.com/">Blue Ocean Gallery</a>, which shows beautiful hand-made furniture.  It's an old industrial space where in the front is the gallery and in the back is a complete woodworking workshop and painting studio.  They get models and the deal is quite a bit like the <a href="http://www.avaaonline.org/">AVAA</a>, put down five dollars and paint for a couple of hours.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3368902369/huge-4-x-2-acrylic-painting.html" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Huge 4 x 2 acrylic painting"><img class="float-left" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3640/3368902369_bc886a8d7c_m.jpg" alt="Huge 4 x 2 acrylic painting" width="158" height="240" /></a> The atmosphere is much better at the AFG as opposed to the AVAA.  There are no senior citizens or smooth jazz at the AFG.  A much younger and hipper crowd overall.  Still a sausage fest, however.  I'd think that art would be a fairly gender neutral pursuit.  But everywhere I go it's all dudes.  How the hell am I supposed to impress women with my skills when it's all guys?</p>
