<p>Here's my display from <a href="http://www.artoutside.org/index.php">Art Outside 2009</a>.  It put on by the Artseen Alliance in Texas farmland outside of Austin.  Evidently it used to take place in Austin, but they had to move because the city built a parking lot or something where it used to be.  OK, I made the parking lot thing up.  I have no idea why it had to move to the countryside.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure what to expect from the event, but there was a lot going on.  For the few hours I was there last night, there were multiple band playing the entire time, a carnival, a fashion show, a film screening, and many contraptions that spit fire.  In all, it was a pretty awesome event.</p>
<p>I was glad that I had to chance to set up my own display.  Since I didn't have frames for any of my paintings, I had the idea to paint frames around them.  I also threw water into the frames to match the drippy aesthetic of the paintings.  I think it came out well.  I took a couple of pictures with my cell phone.</p>
