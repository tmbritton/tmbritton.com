Here's a couple of drawings that I did this afternoon at the life drawing session at the <a href="http://www.avaaonline.org/">AVAA</a>.  I had some toned paper lying around that I hadn't done anything with for a long time, so I used that.  It's always fun to work on toned paper because the paper becomes the mid-tone and you work in both direction from the middle value.  This is different from regular white paper where the paper is the lightest tone in the drawing.<br />

They came out alright.  I like the portrait better, although for some reason it looks religious.  I guess that's the dramatic effect of covering most of the paper with charcoal.  </p>
