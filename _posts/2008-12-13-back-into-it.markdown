<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="121308-2" href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3105463444/121308-2.html"><img class="float-right" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3060/3105463444_68c5006d57_m.jpg" alt="121308-2" width="175" height="240" /></a> It's been about a minute since I last made a post to the site.  Last weekend I got back into the drawing sessions after missing a couple of week due to holiday traveling.  I've been lazy about scanning these.  We had the same guy two days in a row.  I'm only posting the drawings that I think came out well.  So here they are.</p>
<p>It might be time to update the look of this place a bit.  That Flickr plug-in in the sidebar has never really worked.  I've been using a great plug-in for Flash called <a href="http://www.slideshowpro.net">Slideshow Pro</a> at work and recently discovered that it will pull in images from a RSS feed.  It's a much more aesthetically appealing way to present the work.  I might do that soon.<br />
