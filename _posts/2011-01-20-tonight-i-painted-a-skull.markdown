<p>Tonight I went to the Vargas and painted a skull.  They've been doing a still-life a week for a while now with our friend Jay.  This is the first time I've joined them because every previous time I've been drinking or chasing a girl or something similar.  I hope to join them from now on.  I ended up coming up with a pretty decent painting from it.  Oh, and it's oil.  Finally feeling a bit better with oil.</p>
