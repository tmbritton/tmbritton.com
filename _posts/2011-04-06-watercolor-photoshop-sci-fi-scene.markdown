<p>I thought I'd give this process another shot because I like the results from the last one.  I'm still digging it.  I got some feedback from a friend of mine, <a href="http://jrfleming.wordpress.com/">JR Fleming</a>, a fellow geek artist, that the last one lacked darks.  Which I agreed with.  So I tried to make more of a value range with this one.  I also layered in text to see what it looked like.</p>
