<p>This was a test to see what happened when I scan a watercolor drawing and mess with it in Photoshop.  Basically I wanted to see what happened when I tried to draw a more science fictiony scene instead of the usual naked people.  I rather like watercolors.  The key for me seems to be not to try to control them at all.  Stay outside of the lines.  Make it sloppy and call it expressive.  This is a hell of a lot faster and feels more natural than trying to go all digital.  And the watercolor already has a nice texture to it.  I like the way my pencil lines look, not so much inks.  So what do you think, would you read something drawn like this?</p>
