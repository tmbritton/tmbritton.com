<p>I contributed a couple of paintings to a fundraiser for a local indepentant production of a science fiction rock opera called <a href="http://www.myspace.com/fasterthanthespeedoflightthemusical">Faster than the Speed of Light</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/img/2009/05/funwebflyer_2_.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-223" title="funwebflyer_2_" src="/assets/img/2009/05/funwebflyer_2_.jpg" alt="" width="396" height="612" /></a></p>
<p>It's from 6-10 Sunday night, May 3rd, at the <a href="http://www.salvagevanguard.org/">Salvage Vanguard Theatre</a>.  The play looks pretty cool and the fundraiser event sounds like a lot of fun.  There's gonna be bands and probably a lot of short haired girls wearing glasses.  Which is enough to get me to kick in a couple of paintings. <a href="http://do512.com/event/2009/05/03/faster-than-the-speed-of-light-the-fund-raiser">More info here</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the paintings that I contributed:</p>
<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="032309-1" href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3384387438/032309-1.html"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3554/3384387438_f62eb17283_m.jpg" alt="032309-1" width="180" height="240" /></a> <a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="121408-1" href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/3109402812/121408-1.html"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3240/3109402812_99f051fd2a_m.jpg" alt="121408-1" width="240" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>So come on out and pay a lot of money for my paintings, or somebody else's.  It advances the cause of short haired girls doing cool shit.</p>
