<p>Tonight I brought out the oil paints again at the AFG.  It had been  a while since I'd actually done a figure painting.  I wasn't sure I'd remember how.  It had been so long that when I got there my Gamsol was dry so I had not thinner.  This forced me to paint thicker than I normally, which I think was good.  It's always good to do things a bit differently if you're in a rut.  We had a single pose the entire time, so I had a couple of hours to work on this painting.</p>
