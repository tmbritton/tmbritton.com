<p><a href="/assets/img/2008/12/122608-1.jpg"><img class="float-right size-medium wp-image-83" title="122608-1" src="/assets/img/2008/12/122608-1-193x300.jpg" alt="" width="193" height="300" /></a>Here's a couple that I did this week as Christmas presents for my family.  That's a good thing about having some nominal ability to draw and paint.  If you're broke, you can just make Christmas presents.  These are both subjects that I've never drawn or painted before.  A kid and a flower.  They're not really subject matter that I'm drawn to.  As you can see from the rest of my art on this website, I prefer to paint things like empty alcohol containers and naked women.  Things that I can relate to.  OK, that's not true, I'm awful at relating to women.</p>
<p>The flower is a gouache painting on Illustration board.  If you find stuff that's thick enough it won't curl.  The colors are way off in the picture, of course.  The light purple in the flower is much more subtle in real life.  The reference was a photo that my mother took on vacation in Florida.  I'm not sure what kind it is.  In the photo it was red, but when I got ready to paint I discovered that my tube of red was dried out.  So it became orange.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/img/2008/12/122608-2.jpg"><img class="float-right size-medium wp-image-82" title="122608-2" src="/assets/img/2008/12/122608-2-219x300.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="300" /></a>Kids are hard to draw.  In the picture I was looking at of the girls she's about 1 year old.  She looks 5 or 6 in the drawing.  The more more defintion that you put in a drawing of a kid the older they look.  So I told her parents that I had drawn an age-progression of their daughter.  But, they seemed to like it.  I guess people like drawings of their kids.  If somebody gave me a charcoal drawing that they did of me from a photo, I might think it's a bit odd.</p>
<p>So, just so everybody out there knows I haven't been entirely unproductive over my vacation, I thought I'd post the images.</p>
