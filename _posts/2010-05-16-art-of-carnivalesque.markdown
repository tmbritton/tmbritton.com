<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Carnivalesque Flier" href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/4610897964/flier.html"><img class="alignright float-right" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1227/4610897964_6f40467af0_m.jpg" alt="Carnivalesque Flier" width="154" height="240" /></a> Last Friday was Carnivalesque.  It was a burlesque performance put on by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/SmokeandMirrorsCabaret">Smoke and Mirrors Cabaret</a>.  The show was quite a bit different from most burlesque performances that I've seen.  We tried a few experimental ideas with the performance that are not normally seen in burlesque performances.  There was a narrative to the show instead of a disconnected series of performances.  We incorporated some live digital painting into the event.  I made some images that were projected as backgrounds in the performances.</p>
<p>I also did the event flier.  For some reason, when it came time to do the flier my main source of inspiration was the <a href="http://www.drewstruzan.com/">Drew Struzan</a> <a href="http://www.drewstruzan.com/illustrated/portfolio/?fa=large&amp;gid=685&amp;mp&amp;gallerystart=1&amp;pagestart=1&amp;type=mp&amp;gs=1">Blade Runner movie poster</a>.  Because nothing says burlesque like 80's sci-fi and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000442/">Rutger Hauer</a>.  It was digitally painted in Photoshop and sized for print at 11x17.  I didn't know if my computer could handle that many pixels, but it managed.  I based it on photos of the cast from prior events.</p>
<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="live-tent" href="http://www.tmbritton.com/art/photo/4609603355/live-tent.html"><img class="alignright float-right" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3301/4609603355_88efc170f5_m.jpg" alt="live-tent" width="240" height="175" /></a> Originally the idea was to digitally paint the backgrounds as the show was happening.  But after playing with the computer and the projector a bit during a rehearsal we decided that having the painting happening during all of the routines would be too much of a distraction from the focal point of the performance.  That and the fact that most of the performances were only a few minutes long wouldn't give me time for much more than scribbles on the screen.  So I ended up doing a lot of that art for the show before hand.  Since we waited until the weekend before the show to actually hookthe laptop up to a projector, I did the images in two very late nights.  I did have the chance to do a live painting before the show started as people were filtering in to the show.</p>
<p>These are the images that were projected behind the performers.  I had thought that since I wouldn't be able to do paintings during the performances that I would instead do illustrations for each of the backgrounds.  After I spent and evening on a horrible attempt at painting a carnival ground I decided on photo-manipulations instead.  These I could finish quickly enough to have ready in time for the show.</p>

<p>The show went well.  People seemed to really enjoy it.  There's a <a href="http://www.launch787.com/1topics/events/carnivalesque-hits-the-highball/">review of the show on launch787.com</a>.  There's a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/menelaosprokos/sets/72157623920169017/">set of photos from the show on Flickr</a> by photographer <a href="http://menelaosprokos.com/">Menelaos Prokos</a>.  They all look great.  I'm really impressed with all of the photos I've seen from the event.  There's also a video of Miriam's aerial dance routine.<br />
