<p>Hey all, long time, no post.  I finally got back to figure drawing tonight.  It had been a couple of months due to a Linux command line class I've been taking on Monday nights.  Yeah, Linux command line instead of figure drawing.  Where the hell are my priorities?  Well, a couple of months off seemed to treat me well.  I liked my drawings tonight.  Good lighting and a great model helped as well.  But I was looking forward to going tonight whereas it had been a slog for a while to attend the drawing session.  I guess some time off occasionally is helpful.  Here's to more art in 2012.  I think it's about time I start doing something with it.</p>
